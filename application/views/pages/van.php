      <h2>Denmark!</h2>
      <p>
        In the year 1640, in Jutland Denmark, a man named Matthys Corneliussen was born. Nothing is known about his parents or his life in general there. He immigrated to the US, arriving at New Netherlands in 1663.  This is where the VanHorn family begins. Had he never immigrated, we would not be here today.
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        He married Fytje Sophia Brouwer(1664-1709) on February 20, 1692. They had two children during their marriage. He died in 1703 in Monmouth County, New Jersey, at the age of 63.

      <h3>Matthys</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There were three immigrants to New Netherlands whose descendants took some version of the Van Horne surname. The three men were Jan Cornelissen, from Hoorn, North Holland; Christian Barentsen, probably from Hoorn, Terschelling Island, Friesia; and Matthys Cornelissen from Jutland(Denmark). These men were not related, and had absolutely nothing to do with one another after coming to North America.<sub>1</sub></li>
        <li>New Netherlands became what is now known as New York City when the British showed up and forced the city to surrender.</li>
